# news_agg3

The purpose of this program is to build a news aggregator web app that fetches and displays the latest news articles from multiple sources. The app aims to provide users with a user-friendly interface where they can view headlines, read full articles, and filter news by categories or sources. It involves various aspects of web development, including database management, user interface design, and implementing authentication and authorization.

This project is designed as a student project, focusing on providing step-by-step guidance for someone with limited experience in this type of project. The goal is to break down the development process into smaller tasks represented as tickets on a Trello board. Each ticket represents a specific aspect of the project, guiding the student through the implementation process.

The project utilizes Django, a Python web framework, for building the web app. Feedparser library is used for fetching news data from various RSS feeds. The project emphasizes good coding practices, such as keeping sensitive information like the secret key in a gitignore file to maintain security.

Additionally, the project includes deployment on Heroku, a cloud platform, to make the web app accessible to users online. The student will follow the provided guidance and instructions to complete each step, ensuring the project's successful completion. The project also focuses on maintaining a professional directory structure, with careful attention given to the creation and organization of files and folders to avoid any unnecessary modifications later on.
